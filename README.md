JavaScript Label creator is a very handy UI component for collecting options, search filters etc from users. It make it easy for users to make their selections and add or remove tags.
You can add tags/labels, and also be able to delete them.  
The vanilla JavaScript code light and is heavily commented for easy understanding. 
I hope you find it useful.
